### What I learned

#### Unveiling the Power of the `<details>` Tag for Interactive FAQs

Recently, I explored the powerful `<details>` HTML tag, which allows for creating interactive, collapsible content sections on a webpage. This tag is especially useful for FAQs, where users can click to reveal or hide additional information as needed, making the content more dynamic and user-friendly.

```html
<details>
    <summary class="faq-question">...</summary>
    <p>...</p>
</details>
```

#### Using the `<picture>` Tag

In this project, I learned how to use the <picture> tag in HTML to display different images based on the screen resolution. This approach is useful for serving appropriate images for various device sizes, improving both performance and user experience.

```css
<picture>
    <!-- Image for screens wider than 1050px -->
    <source media="(min-width: 1050px)" srcset="desktop.jpg">
    <!-- Default image for smaller screens -->
    <img src="mobile.jpg" alt="..">
</picture>
```

#### CSS Positioning

I have learned how to use positioning in CSS to control the placement and layering of elements on a webpage. CSS positioning allows you to specify how elements should be positioned within their containing element or the viewport.

```css
.accordion::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 200px;
    left: -80px;
}
```
